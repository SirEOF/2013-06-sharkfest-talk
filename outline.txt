As a group. the security industry has solved a lot of difficult
problems.  Firewalls do a great job blocking traffic, overflow
vulnerabilities are getting hard and harder to exploit on modern
systems, and spam filters/captchas are nearly perfect. But there's one
place where we have dropped the ball: cryptography. Why is cryptography
so hard to get right? As a developer, you have to understand random
numbers, key generation, padding, block chaining, initialization
vectors, proper signature generation, and more, just to be somewhat
safe. Even security professionals manage to screw it up, so how do we
expect an average developer to get it right?

For this talk, we'll be getting into deep detail on a bunch of well
known attacks against crypto - including padding oracles (the Vaudenay
attack), hash length extension, BEAST, CRIME, poorly generated random
numbers, WEP, and more - to help demonstrate the problem, and begin to
look at how we might be able to fix it.
